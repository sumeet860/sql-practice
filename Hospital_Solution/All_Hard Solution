For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.
SELECT FLOOR(weight/10)*10 AS weight_group, COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM patients
GROUP BY weight_group
ORDER BY weight_group DESC;

select weight from patients
order by weight asc;

2. Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table.

Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)2) >= 30.
weight is in units kg.
height is in units cm.
select patient_id, weight, height,
case when weight/power(height/100.0,2) >= 30 then 1 else 0 end as isObese
from patients;

from patients p join
admissions a using(patient_id)
join doctors d on a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
where a.diagnosis = 'Epilepsy' and
d.first_name = 'Lisa';
