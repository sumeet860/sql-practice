1. Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups.
Show the total amount of patients in each weight group.
Order the list by the weight group decending.

For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.
SELECT FLOOR(weight/10)*10 AS weight_group, COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM patients
GROUP BY weight_group
ORDER BY weight_group DESC;

select weight from patients
order by weight asc;

2. Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table.
Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1.
Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)2) >= 30.
weight is in units kg.
height is in units cm.
select patient_id, weight, height,
case when weight/power(height/100.0,2) >= 30 then 1 else 0 end as isObese
from patients;

3. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty.
Show only the patients who has a diagnosis as 'Epilepsy' and the doctor's first name is 'Lisa'

Check patients, admissions, and doctors tables for required information. 
select p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, d.specialty
from patients p join
admissions a using(patient_id)
join doctors d on a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
where a.diagnosis = 'Epilepsy' and
d.first_name = 'Lisa';

4. All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site.
Those patients are given a temporary password after their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.

The password must be the following, in order:
1. patient_id
2. the numerical length of patient's last_name
3. year of patient's birth_date
select a.patient_id, temp_password
from (select patient_id, concat(patient_id, len(last_name), year(birth_date)) as temp_password
      from patients) as p
      join admissions a using(patient_id)
      group by a.patient_id;

5. Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.
Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.
select has_insurance, sum(cost_after_insurance) from
(select
case when patient_id % 2 = 0 then "Yes" else "No" end as has_insurance,
case when patient_id % 2 = 0 then 10 else 50 end as cost_after_insurance
from admissions)
group by has_insurance;

6. Show the provinces that has more patients identified as 'M' than 'F'. Must only show full province_name
SELECT 
    province_name
FROM 
    patients p join province_names pn using(province_id)
GROUP BY 
    province_name
HAVING 
    SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)

7. We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:
- First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.
- Identifies their gender as 'F'
- Born in February, May, or December
- Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg
- Their patient_id is an odd number
- They are from the city 'Kingston'
select patient_id, first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city,
province_id, allergies, height, weight
from patients
where patient_id % 2 = 1
and first_name like '__r%' 
and gender is 'F'
and month(birth_date) in (02, 05, 12)
and city in ('Kingston')

8. Show the percent of patients that have 'M' as their gender. Round the answer to the nearest hundreth number and in percent form.
with count_ as
(select count(*) male_count from patients
where gender = 'M'),
total_ as
(select count(*) total_count from patients)
select concat(round(male_count * 100.0 /total_count,2),'%') from 
count_,total_;
